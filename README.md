# pytorch_image_classification (in progress)

This project uses PyTorch framework<br>
and AWS SageMaker to train image classifier<br>
to classify blood cell images.<br><br>

The classification is based on ResNet50 model that we fine-tune here for the target dataset<br>
while utilizing SageMaker profiling, debugger, and hyperparameter tuning.<br>

This project was part of my Machine Learning Nanodegree at Udacity<br>
The dataset I chosen come from [kaggle/paultimothymooney/blood-cells](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells)<br>
containing 4 classes of cells types: Eosinophils, Lymphocytes, Monocytes, and Neutrophils.<br><br>
